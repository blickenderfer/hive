### Description
    
The goal of this project was to create a unique website using react GraphQL, Node.js and Express.js servers, while using MongoDB and Mongoose ODM for the databases.  We Created queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data, and deployed our site with Heroku.  With this site, a user will be able to create a profile and log in, search for video games, add the games to their dashboard, review the added games, and follow links for more details about the games.
